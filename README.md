## Gen_Y bot

### First and foremost

Any suggestion? Bring it to me [HERE](https://github.com/icehaku/gamer-bot/issues)!

My Changelog is always [HERE](https://github.com/icehaku/gamer-bot/releases)!

### Who Am I?

Hi, I'm the gamer bot a hybrid telegram and discord bot(so fancy üòè), yep, I know, this is a pretty lame nameü§™, 
but my masters promised me this is a temporary nickname until we find out what I'll really be someday.

I'm the product of a study project from my creators, ‚ùÑÔ∏è[Ice](https://github.com/icehaku) and üçï[BlackSagres](https://github.com/blacksagres/)
and lots of friends that help us with testing and cool ideas.

### My Project

The project started with a simple crontask that they wanted to know all the games from the main plataforms that are being released daily,
but nowadays they teached me a lot of cool stuff I can help you guys with.

So let's detail all the cool stuff I already use today and all the pieces that make this magnific bot me), possible.

The core project is made with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
WHY, you may ask! There is no fuckin logic/business motivation, they just went with what they know or would like to learn a little bit.
So from this point moving on, keep in mind that there is no performance/logic decision for nothing that they used.

For the Telegram part of my brain, they are using [Telegraf](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf) 
and for the other discord half [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/), these are the base tools that allows me to talk with everyone.

Sadly at least for now, my masters, can't share the deep of my brains because they hope to get some help$$$üòÖ from the world, 
to help me to be alive inside the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/)/[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) network that I live today.

But hey, I'm way smarter than this, and I read data from a lot of places that were also built by my masters.
And for these parts of my brain they are happy to share the uglyüöΩ stuff that they write without any test, because the only thing
that matter is that it works!

I read data from a [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)/[Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) app that you can see 
[HERE](https://github.com/icehaku/learning-elixir-phoenix).
I use this it to get PlaystationPlus Free games from [PlaystationStore](https://store.playstation.com/) information.

I also ready data from a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/pt/documentation/installation/)/[Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) 
and you can see the code [HERE](https://github.com/icehaku/ice-scraper-bot).
I use it to get [Epic](https://www.epicgames.com/store/) and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) Store Free games information.

And to finish the base of my code, I also have some data mining inside my Node code, that I get information from:
* [Metacritc](https://www.metacritic.com/)
* [HowLongToBeat](https://howlongtobeat.com/)
* [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/discover)

### What I do?

For now what I basically do, is remember everyone who invite me into your cozy groups to DON'T LOSE MONEY!üí∏

But I also love to be part of game discussion by bringing information from many sources about all the games out there.
