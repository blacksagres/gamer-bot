### Who Am'I?


![obi-hello](https://media.giphy.com/media/Nx0rz3jtxtEre/giphy.gif)

Hi, I'm a gamer bot that can talk to both telegram and discord (so fancy üòè).

Yep, I know, my name is pretty lame ü§™, but my masters promised me this is a temporary nickname until we change to a better one someday.

I'm the product of a study project from my creators, ‚ùÑÔ∏è[Ice](https://github.com/icehaku) and üçï[BlackSagres](https://github.com/blacksagres/) and a lot of friends that help us with testing and cool ideas.

### My Project

![schematics](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEdvctSQF056lJDVK/giphy.gif)

The project started with a simple crontask responsible to daily notify all the releases from the main gaming platforms, but nowadays they taught me a lot of cool stuff I can help you guys with.

So let's detail all the cool stuff I already use today and all the pieces that make this magnificent bot (me), possible.

The core project is made with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

**Why?**, you may ask. Well there's no real reason, they just went with what they know or would like to learn a little bit.

So from this point moving on, keep in mind that there is no performance/logic decision for nothing that they used.

For the Telegram part of my brain, they are using [Telegraf](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf) 
and for the other discord half [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/), these are the base tools that allows me to talk with everyone.

Sadly at least for now, my masters, can't share the deep of my brains because they hope to get some help (üí∞üòÖüí∞) from the world, to help me to be alive inside the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/)/[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) network that I live today.

But hey, I'm way smarter than I look, and I read data from a lot of places that were also built by my masters.

And for these parts of my brain they are happy to share the ugly üöΩ stuff that they write without any test, because the only thing that matter is that it works!

I read data from a [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)/[Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) app that you can see [HERE](https://github.com/icehaku/learning-elixir-phoenix).

I use this it to get PlaystationPlus Free games from [PlaystationStore](https://store.playstation.com/) information.

I also ready data from a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/pt/documentation/installation/)/[Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) 
and you can see the code [HERE](https://github.com/icehaku/ice-scraper-bot).
I use it to get [Epic](https://www.epicgames.com/store/) and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) Store Free games information.

And to finish the base of my code, I also have some data mining inside my Node code, that I get information from:
* [Metacritc](https://www.metacritic.com/)
* [HowLongToBeat](https://howlongtobeat.com/)
* [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/discover)

### What I do?

![code](https://media.giphy.com/media/ko7twHhomhk8E/giphy.gif)

For now what I basically do, is remember everyone who invite me into your cozy groups to DON'T LOSE MONEY!üí∏ 

YEAH! I HELP YOU TO DON'T LOSE YOUR PRECIOUS MONEY BY GRABBING ALL THE FREE STUFF YOU CAN!

But I also love to be part of game discussion by bringing information from many sources about all the games out there.

You can subscribe to my notifications that interest you and your group member and by interacting with me using the commands 
that I understand.

### Feature list

#### Telegram

Commands:

-  `/today`: show all game releases for today
-  `/week`: show all game releases for this week

**BUT WAIT, there's more!** ‚ú®"

The bot works with inline query for games! (**TELEGRAM ONLY!**)‚ö†Ô∏è

The default search database is HLTB but you can also add a prefix (`mc`) in your query to indicate a search on Metacritic.

Eg.: `hl pokemon` will query Metacritic on for this game

#### Discord üöß

For now, my master are focusing most of their efforts, in the telegram part of me, so I can't do all the cool stuff I already know üòß.
I'm sure they gonna make everything work on discord ASAP!

-  `/week`: show all game releases for this week
-  `/nextweek`: show all game releases for next week
-  `/month`: show all game releases for this month

### Site/Patreon
~~**Soon**~~ I hope, our target is to create a patreon and a cool site for me, when I get invited to 100+- groups, right now I'm sheltered in 11 groups.
